# Battery-Testing-Data-Plotting
In battery test, the charge-discharge data is one of the most important performance to present how good a battery is. In particular, a batch of batteries are tested at the same time with same testing profile in a battery lab. It is very necessary to process these data efficiently. I developed a python-based tool which can batch processing a group of battery charge-discharge testing data and plot them for a better comparison. The cycling curve with both “Specific capacity” and “Coulombic efficiency” as the y variables, the charge-discharge curves as “Voltage” vs. “Capacity”, and the statistic table of initial Coulombic efficiency & reversible Coulombic efficiency are all analyzed at one click. This tool saves a lot of data processing time, especially for these high throughput experiments.
